## Summary

**`Simple Robot`** v4 is a multi-platform Bot-style high-
performance asynchronous event scheduling framework based on 
**KMP** (hereafter referred to as simbot).
It provides a unified asynchronous API and easy-to-use style design, 
which can help you write bot-style event scheduling applications 
more quickly and efficiently.

Currently, it is mainly used to interface with various types of 
bot application platforms/frameworks and provides part of 
the component library implementation.

**`simbot4`** Developed via [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language,
Based on [KMP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) for 
multi-platform support, and compatible with Java (**jdk11+**) and 
other JVM platform languages.

And provides a lot of Java-friendly API and Spring Boot starter, 
to help you quickly develop .

This repository is the repository for simbot v3 and v4, containing 
the definition of the simbot standard API, the implementation of 
the simbot core libraries, and the implementation of the Spring Boot starter 
and other core and basic content.
